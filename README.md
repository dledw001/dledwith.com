My simple, personal website.

## Stack
- Hosted in a Debian 12 virtual machine on my NAS. NGINX web server.
- Routed through Cloudflare Tunnels, which is free. 
- I pay nothing aside from the domain registration fee.

I use server-side includes (SSI).
- partials/: navbar/footer/boilerplate includes
